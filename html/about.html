      <h1>Proud locally-owned business since 1891</h1>
      <p>
        Ever since our founder Casey David created byteCafe in 1891, our mission
        has been to provide high quality organic coffee. Sourced straight from
        locally-owned sustainable farms across South America, our famous coffees
        provide a taste unmatched across the Northeast. We continuously seek to
        improve our selection of foods and drinks while keeping true to our
        quality standards.

            Today's byteCafe is in the capable hands of Taylor Evans. Evans is a
            true coffee aficionado, having graduated with a Master's degree in
            Coffee Science from the University of California, Davis. Evan's
            commitment to making the greatest coffee has led him to travel the
            seven continents in search for the hidden coffee-making secrets of
            the world. It's on the backs of all the great coffee brewers of
            history, that byteCafe is able to present its selections of coffees,
            drinks, and delicious foods.
          </p>

            At the heart of byteCafe is our community - the coffee lovers that
            made our business possible. We seek to contribute a peaceful
            relaxing atmosphere where people can come in to hang out, study, and
            enjoy a nice sip of coffee. Feel free to visit at any time.
